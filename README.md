# Weather API Debug

Creating a weather API to help me practice and learn about what an API is in general.

Work is done in **python** and utilizes JSON, time, requests, and pprint for debugging

I believe thats going to be it for now...

## **Plans for the future**
***
> * Would like to create a website
>   * Preferably with a different language like Javascript
>   * Make it all nice and snazzy with CSS and HTML
>   * Regarded as the 3 cornerstones of Web Development
***
> * *Mainly* try not to die inside when I can't do it...

# **Edit**

Branch was created for debugging the file.

> **Program takes a list of cities**
> * Iterates through the list
> * Mission is to find weather descriptions that aren't in the code so that it doesn't throw an error.

*Thats all I have now*
